# Using Gitpod

## Why use Gitpod
Lets me create this post from my Android tablet

## Setup
1. Prefix your github repo with `gitpod.io/#`. For example this blog repo at `https://github.com/ivanfoong/ivanfoong.github.io`, the resulting url should be `gitpod.io/#https://github.com/ivanfoong/ivanfoong.github.io`

## Usage
You should be redirected with a new vscode server with your repo cloned into the workspace and ready for you to start working your project
